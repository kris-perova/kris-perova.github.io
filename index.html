        <p class="about-me">I'm Kristina. <br>I love both art and technology, and web development lets me blend these passions. I enjoy turning a blank page into something vibrant and interactive. I want to become a skilled developer, constantly learning new things and applying that knowledge in practice. I don’t shy away from challenges; they make the journey even more exciting. I’m looking forward to making a meaningful contribution to the world of technology.<br>Let's connect and see how we can work together!</p>
